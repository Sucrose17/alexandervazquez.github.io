        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            I am a dedicated and passionate undergraduate mathematics student in my final year of
            Applied Mathematics at the Autonomous University of Baja California, currently
            participating in an exchange program at the National Autonomous University of Mexico. My
            academic focus lies in algebra and number theory, with a particular interest in modular forms
            and elliptic curves, areas that ignited my passion for the field through key research
            experiences. I am committed to advancing pure mathematics, driven by a desire to solve
            complex problems and contribute to the academic community.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition to research, I am passionate about the divulgation of higher mathematics to the general public, aiming to make
            complex mathematical ideas more accessible. With a solid foundation in both research and
            outreach, I am eager to pursue graduate studies and a career in academia to further explore
            algebraic structures and their applications.
